      <h1>Present</h1>
      <p>In the article, an autonomous car from Uber hit a homeless woman who was <br>J-walking. After some investigation, it was concluded that multiple parties could be at fault. First, the Homeless woman was on methamphetamines. Second, the autonomous car had a testing person in the drivers seat who was supposed to be watching the road in case the car didnt see anything. Finally, Uber seemed to have rushed the testing process, and their system probably wasnt ready to be tested on city streets. </p>

      <h1>Analysis</h1>
      <p>The technological error that cause the accident was from the LIDAR system not detecting Elaine Herzberg. This error could also be caused by the lack of testing and the software not being ready for public use. Along with that, I believe that it is the role of a "driver" in a self-driving car to still keep thier eyes on the road so that in the case that the car doesnt see someting, they can take control and stop the accident.</p>

      <h1>What's Next</h1>
      <p>In the future, I think that autonomous car companies need to be held to a certain standard for testing the sensor system before they can be used on public roads, so that the accident that happened in the article doesnt happen again. This testing could be done on a closed driving course where different scenarios are tested and obsevations can be made about how the car reacts.</p>
